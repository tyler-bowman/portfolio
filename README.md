Personal Portfolio Website

This project is a fully custom personal portfolio website built using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS. The site is designed to highlight my experience in software engineering, AI/ML, and web development, while also presenting my work in a visually polished and modern way. It includes custom-built backgrounds, smooth transitions between sections, an About Me section with an image carousel, a dedicated Seeweed experience section, a projects showcase, and an interactive contact/footer area.

The site uses a completely original “machine learning grid” background system that I created by layering CSS gradients, glow layers, and grid patterns. Two versions of this background exist: a white-to-black version and a black-to-white version. These backgrounds are used throughout the site to keep a consistent, branded visual style.

Main Features:

• Fully custom ML-themed background (ml-grid-bg and ml-grid-bg1), built with CSS gradients and grid overlays.

• Modern Hero section with a large headshot, introduction text, and call-to-action button.

• About Me section styled with ml-grid-bg1 and centered vertically within a full-screen layout. Includes an image carousel with captions describing important areas of my life.

• Dedicated Seeweed section describing the machine learning work I completed during my internship, including custom AI model development, Discovery Channel project delivery, AWS/Vertex AI workflows, and dataset engineering.

• Projects section featuring three project cards with screenshots, descriptions, and links to GitHub repositories.

• Integrated PDF viewer for my resume, transcripts, and recommendation letters.

• Smooth color transitions throughout the site, ensuring each section blends cleanly with the next.

• Responsive design using TailwindCSS, making the site work cleanly on desktop and mobile.

• Clean navigation bar with styled links to each section: About, Seeweed, Projects, and Contact.

Technologies Used:

• React (Component-based architecture)
• Vite (Fast development environment)
• TailwindCSS (Utility-based styling)
• Custom CSS for ML backgrounds
• PDF viewer components
• JavaScript and JSX for interactive UI logic

Purpose of This Project:

This website serves as a professional showcase of my skillset, projects, and experience. It demonstrates my ability to design and build modern web interfaces, write clean and maintainable code, and present technical work clearly. It also documents the machine learning and software engineering work I've completed, including high-pressure deadlines and real-world production tasks.
